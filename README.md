## 🎮 Game Description

Pokémon Battle Game is a browser-based mini game inspired by the classic Pokémon battle system.

Players can select a Pokémon, choose moves, and battle against a computer-controlled opponent. Each move has limited usage (PP), damage is calculated based on attack and defense, and HP bars update dynamically during the fight.

I built this project because Pokémon has always been a nostalgic favorite, and I wanted to challenge myself by recreating a simplified version of its battle mechanics using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.
